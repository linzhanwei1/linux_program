/* is_echo_sv.c
 * An implementation of the TCP "echo" service.
 * NOTE:this program must be run under a root login, in order to allow the "echo" port (7) to be bound.
 * Alternatively, for test purposes, you can replace the SERVICE name below with a suitable unreserved port number
 * (e.g., "51000"), and make a corresponding change in the client.
